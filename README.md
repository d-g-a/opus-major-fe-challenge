## Deployed on Vercel

Access the site in this url: https://opus-major-fe-challenge.vercel.app/

## Things to know

- Sounds play when you click on the page.

- As the user creation with the api provided is not much, I used a math.random to generate a random number of users created per minute. 

## or run locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
